## Notes

Could I have made this easier on myself? Yes, most definitely!

I wanted to practice the lessons taught in the section so far and I realized you can make it REACT-like. I have a better appreciation for REACT after doing this project. It does so much under the hood for the programmer and precents some issues that I encountered such as variables being defined before use, adding onto the DOM, and state handling.
